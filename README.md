# 🤖 AI Chatbot using NLTK
This is a simple AI chatbot built using **Python** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with the **NLTK library**. The chatbot can understand and respond to basic user queries using a rule-based intent matching system.
---

## 📌 Features
* Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
* Rule-based intent recognition
* Randomized responses for each intent
* Easy-to-extend structure (add your own intents/responses)
* Runs entirely offline (no external APIs required)
---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/)
---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install nltk
```

### Download Required NLTK Resources
Run this in your Python shell or script:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## 📈 Future Improvements
* Integrate ML-based intent classification
* Add context awareness (dialog state)
* Use spaCy or transformers for better NLP
* Web/GUI interface (e.g., Flask, Streamlit)
